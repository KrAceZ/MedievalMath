Welcome to MedievalMath, a fun, interactive, educational application for tutoring children in math using the Massachusetts Kindergarten-4th math curriculum.

System Overview: Medieval Math 
Medieval Math is an educational platform designed to enhance the mathematics learning experience for students with the Massachusetts Kindergarten–4th grade mathematics curriculum through a fun and engaging medieval-themed environment. The system is supported by a MySQL database that securely stores user profiles, including personal details such as student name, username, user ID, password, and grade level, along with dynamic data like points and achievements. The application facilitates a seamless user experience from the login page, where users can either create a new profile or log into an existing one. This initial interaction ensures that all user credentials are verified for security before granting access to the personalized learning dashboard.

Feature Description: User Interaction and Progress Tracking 
Once logged in, users are greeted by the homepage, which acts as the nerve center of the application, directing them to various educational and interactive pages like quizzes, tests, tutorials, and a virtual shop. As students navigate through the quizzes and tests, they encounter problems curated to match their grade level, ensuring an adaptive learning experience. Each correct answer rewards the user with points, which not only serve as a motivational tool but can also be used to purchase items in the medieval shop or unlock achievements. This gamification is central to keeping students engaged and encouraging continual improvement.

Database Integration and Data Persistence 
Critical to the application’s functionality is its integration with a back-end MySQL database that updates user profiles in real-time. When a user decides to log out, the system automatically synchronizes their in-session achievements—such as new points earned, achievements unlocked, and items purchased from the shop—with their stored profile in the database. This ensures that each user's learning progress and rewards are saved and ready to be resumed in the next session. This seamless integration between the front-end user interface and the back-end database supports a continuous and personalized user experience, making Medieval .Math a reliable and effective educational tool.
